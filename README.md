# PropBank

In the field of SRL, PropBank is one of the studies widely recognized by the computational linguistics communities. PropBank is the bank of propositions where predicate- argument information of the corpora is annotated, and the semantic roles or arguments that each verb can take are posited.

Each verb has a frame file, which contains arguments applicable to that verb. Frame files may include more than one roleset with respect to the senses of the given verb. In the roleset of a verb sense, argument labels Arg0 to Arg5 are described according to the meaning of the verb. For the example below, the predicate is “announce” from PropBank, Arg0 is “announcer”, Arg1 is “entity announced”, and ArgM- TMP is “time attribute”.

[<sub>ARG0</sub> Türk Hava Yolları] [<sub>ARG1</sub> indirimli satışlarını] [<sub>ARGM-TMP</sub> bu Pazartesi] [<sub>PREDICATE</sub> açıkladı].

[<sub>ARG0</sub> Turkish Airlines] [<sub>PREDICATE</sub> announced] [<sub>ARG1</sub> its discounted fares] [<sub>ARGM-TMP</sub> this Monday].

The following Table shows typical semantic role types. Only Arg0 and Arg1 indicate the same thematic roles across different verbs: Arg0 stands for the Agent or Causer and Arg1 is the Patient or Theme. The rest of the thematic roles can vary across different verbs. They can stand for Instrument, Start point, End point, Beneficiary, or Attribute. Moreover, PropBank uses ArgM’s as modifier labels indicating time, location, temporal, goal, cause etc., where the role is not specific to a single verb group; it generalizes over the entire corpus instead.

|Tag|Meaning|
|---|---|
|Arg0|Agent or Causer|
|ArgM-EXT|Extent|
|Arg1|Patient or Theme|
|ArgM-LOC|Locatives|
|Arg2|Instrument, start point, end point, beneficiary, or attribute|
|ArgM-CAU|Cause|
|ArgM-MNR|Manner|
|ArgM-DIS|Discourse|
|ArgM-ADV|Adverbials|
|ArgM-DIR|Directionals|
|ArgM-PNC|Purpose|
|ArgM-TMP|Temporals|

## Data Format

The structure of a sample frameset is as follows:

	<FRAMESET id="0006410">
		<ARG name="ARG0">Açan</ARG>
		<ARG name="ARG1">Açılan şey</ARG>
		<ARG name="ARGMTMP">Açılma zamanı</ARG>
	</FRAMESET>

Each entry in the frame file is enclosed by <FRAMESET> and </FRAMESET> tags. id shows the unique identifier given to the frameset, which is the same ID in the synset file of the corresponding verb sense. <ARG> tags denote the semantic roles of the corresponding frame.
