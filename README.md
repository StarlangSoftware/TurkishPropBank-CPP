Turkish PropBank (TRopBank)
============

Turkish PropBank (TRopBank) is a corpus of over 17.000 Turkish verbs, each annotated with their syntactic arguments and thematic roles. Arguments are bits of essential information attached to a verb (such as subject or object), and thematic roles are semantic classifications associated with these arguments (such as agent or patient). This resource allows matching between the syntax layer and the semantics layer for the processing of Turkish data.

In the field of SRL, PropBank is one of the studies widely recognized by the computational linguistics communities. PropBank is the bank of propositions where predicate- argument information of the corpora is annotated, and the semantic roles or arguments that each verb can take are posited.

Each verb has a frame file, which contains arguments applicable to that verb. Frame files may include more than one roleset with respect to the senses of the given verb. In the roleset of a verb sense, argument labels Arg0 to Arg5 are described according to the meaning of the verb. For the example below, the predicate is “announce” from PropBank, Arg0 is “announcer”, Arg1 is “entity announced”, and ArgM- TMP is “time attribute”.

[<sub>ARG0</sub> Türk Hava Yolları] [<sub>ARG1</sub> indirimli satışlarını] [<sub>ARGM-TMP</sub> bu Pazartesi] [<sub>PREDICATE</sub> açıkladı].

[<sub>ARG0</sub> Turkish Airlines] [<sub>PREDICATE</sub> announced] [<sub>ARG1</sub> its discounted fares] [<sub>ARGM-TMP</sub> this Monday].

The following Table shows typical semantic role types. Only Arg0 and Arg1 indicate the same thematic roles across different verbs: Arg0 stands for the Agent or Causer and Arg1 is the Patient or Theme. The rest of the thematic roles can vary across different verbs. They can stand for Instrument, Start point, End point, Beneficiary, or Attribute. Moreover, PropBank uses ArgM’s as modifier labels indicating time, location, temporal, goal, cause etc., where the role is not specific to a single verb group; it generalizes over the entire corpus instead.

|Tag|Meaning|
|---|---|
|Arg0|Agent or Causer|
|ArgM-EXT|Extent|
|Arg1|Patient or Theme|
|ArgM-LOC|Locatives|
|Arg2|Instrument, start point, end point, beneficiary, or attribute|
|ArgM-CAU|Cause|
|ArgM-MNR|Manner|
|ArgM-DIS|Discourse|
|ArgM-ADV|Adverbials|
|ArgM-DIR|Directionals|
|ArgM-PNC|Purpose|
|ArgM-TMP|Temporals|

+ Directional modifiers give information regarding the path of motion in the sentence. Directional modifiers may be mistakenly tagged as locatives.
+ Locatives are used for the place where the action takes place.
+ Manners define how the action is performed.
+ Extent markers represent the amount of change that occurs in the action.
+ Temporal modifiers keep the time of the action.
+ Reciprocals are reflexives that refer to other arguments, like “himself,” “itself,” “together,” “each other,” and “both.”
+ Secondary predication markers are used for adjuncts of the predicate, which holds predicate structure.
+ Purpose clauses show the motivation for the action. Cause clauses simply show the reason for an action.
+ Discourse markers connect the sentence to the previous sentence, such as “also,” “however,” “as well,” and “but.”
+ Adverbials are used for syntactic elements that modify the sentence and are not labeled with one of the modifier tags stated above.
+ “Will,” “may,” “can,” “must,” “shall,” “might,” “should,” “could,” “would,” and also “going (to),” “have (to),” and “used (to)” are modality adjuncts of the predicate and tagged as modal in PropBank.
+ Negation is used to tag negative markers of the sentences.

## Data Format

The structure of a sample frameset is as follows:

	<FRAMESET id="TR10-0006410">
		<ARG name="ARG0">Engeli kaldıran kişi</ARG>
		<ARG name="ARG1">Engelini kaldırdığı şey</ARG>
	</FRAMESET>

Each entry in the frame file is enclosed by <FRAMESET> and </FRAMESET> tags. id shows the unique identifier given to the frameset, which is the same ID in the synset file of the corresponding verb sense. <ARG> tags denote the semantic roles of the corresponding frame.

conan list

### conanfile.py file

1. Put the correct dependencies in the requires part
```
    requires = ["math/1.0.0", "classification/1.0.0"]
```

2. Default settings are:
```
    settings = "os", "compiler", "build_type", "arch"
    options = {"shared": [True, False], "fPIC": [True, False]}
    default_options = {"shared": True, "fPIC": True}
    exports_sources = "src/*", "Test/*"

    def layout(self):
        cmake_layout(self, src_folder="src")

    def generate(self):
        tc = CMakeToolchain(self)
        tc.generate()
        deps = CMakeDeps(self)
        deps.generate()

    def build(self):
        cmake = CMake(self)
        cmake.configure()
        cmake.build()

    def package(self):
        copy(conanfile=self, keep_path=False, src=join(self.source_folder), dst=join(self.package_folder, "include"), pattern="*.h")
        copy(conanfile=self, keep_path=False, src=self.build_folder, dst=join(self.package_folder, "lib"), pattern="*.a")
        copy(conanfile=self, keep_path=False, src=self.build_folder, dst=join(self.package_folder, "lib"), pattern="*.so")
        copy(conanfile=self, keep_path=False, src=self.build_folder, dst=join(self.package_folder, "lib"), pattern="*.dylib")
        copy(conanfile=self, keep_path=False, src=self.build_folder, dst=join(self.package_folder, "bin"), pattern="*.dll")

    def package_info(self):
        self.cpp_info.libs = ["ComputationalGraph"]
```

### CMakeLists.txt file
1. Set the C++ standard with compiler flags.
```
	set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20)
	set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "-O3")
```
2. Dependent packages should be given with find_package.
```
	find_package(util_c REQUIRED)
	find_package(data_structure_c REQUIRED)
```
3. For library part, use add_library and target_link_libraries commands. Use m library for math linker in Linux.
```
	add_library(Math src/Distribution.cpp src/Distribution.h src/DiscreteDistribution.cpp src/DiscreteDistribution.h src/Vector.cpp src/Vector.h src/Eigenvector.cpp src/Eigenvector.h src/Matrix.cpp src/Matrix.h src/Tensor.cpp src/Tensor.h)
	target_link_libraries(Math util_c::util_c data_structure_c::data_structure_c m)
```
4. For executable tests, use add_executable and target_link_libraries commands. Use m library for math linker in Linux.
```
	add_executable(DiscreteDistributionTest src/Distribution.cpp src/Distribution.h src/DiscreteDistribution.cpp src/DiscreteDistribution.h src/Vector.cpp src/Vector.h src/Eigenvector.cpp src/Eigenvector.h src/Matrix.cpp src/Matrix.h src/Tensor.cpp src/Tensor.h Test/DiscreteDistributionTest.cpp)
	target_link_libraries(DiscreteDistributionTest util_c::util_c data_structure_c::data_structure_c m)
```

### Data files
1. Add data files to the cmake-build-debug folder.

### C++ files

1. If needed, comparator operators == and < should be implemented for map and set data structures.
```
    bool operator==(const Word &anotherWord) const{
        return (name == anotherWord.name);
    }
    bool operator<(const Word &anotherWord) const{
        return (name < anotherWord.name);
    }
```
2. Do not forget to comment each function.
```
	/**
 	* A constructor of Word class which gets a String name as an input and assigns to the name variable.
	*
	* @param _name String input.
 	*/
	Word::Word(const string &_name) {
```
3. Function names should follow caml case.
```
	int Word::charCount() const
```
4. Write getter and setter methods.
```
	string Word::getName() const
	void Word::setName(const string &_name)
```
5. Use catch.hpp for testing purposes. Add
```
#define CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN  // This tells Catch to provide a main() - only do this in one cpp file
```
line in only one of the test files. Add
```
#include "catch.hpp"
```
line in all test files. Example test file is given below:
```
TEST_CASE("DictionaryTest") {
    TxtDictionary lowerCaseDictionary = TxtDictionary("lowercase.txt", "turkish_misspellings.txt");
    TxtDictionary mixedCaseDictionary = TxtDictionary("mixedcase.txt", "turkish_misspellings.txt");
    TxtDictionary dictionary = TxtDictionary();
    SECTION("testSize"){
        REQUIRE(29 == lowerCaseDictionary.size());
        REQUIRE(58 == mixedCaseDictionary.size());
        REQUIRE(62113 == dictionary.size());
    }
    SECTION("testGetWord"){
        for (int i = 0; i < dictionary.size(); i++){
            REQUIRE_FALSE(nullptr == dictionary.getWord(i));
        }
    }
    SECTION("testLongestWordSize"){
        REQUIRE(1 == lowerCaseDictionary.longestWordSize());
        REQUIRE(1 == mixedCaseDictionary.longestWordSize());
        REQUIRE(21 == dictionary.longestWordSize());
    }
```
6. Enumerated types should be declared with enum class.
```
	enum class Pos {
		ADJECTIVE,
		NOUN,
		VERB,
		ADVERB,
```
7. Every header file should start with
```
	#ifndef MATH_DISTRIBUTION_H
	#define MATH_DISTRIBUTION_H
```
and end with
```
	#endif //MATH_DISTRIBUTION_H
```
8. Do not forget to use const expression for parameters, if they will not be changed in the function.
```
	void Word::setName(const string &_name);
```
9. Do not forget to use const expression for methods, which do not modify any class attribute. Also use [[dodiscard]]
```
	[[nodiscard]] bool isPunctuation() const;
```
10. Use xmlparser package for parsing xml files.
```
    auto* doc = new XmlDocument("test.xml");
    doc->parse();
    XmlElement* root = doc->getFirstChild();
    XmlElement* firstChild = root->getFirstChild();
```
11. Data structures: Use map for hash map, unordered_map for linked hash map, vector for array list, unordered_set for hash set
